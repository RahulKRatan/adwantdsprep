Eg:
S : I’m going to tell you about something that happened at my summer internship. I was interning at Facebook after my junior year of college.
T : My mentor asked me to stay late at work one night toward the end of my internship to help him with a project.
A : We were working on building out a new message handler for X service. I didn’t know too much about Y and Z technology, but he helped me figure it out, and by 1 am we had built a working prototype. Over the next two weeks, we refined it and pushed it into production.
R : As a result of our all-nighter, we got our code up two weeks ahead of schedule, and I made my mentor look really good. I also learned a lot of new technology, and we managed to speed up job handling by 20 percent. That’s an example of a time when I exceeded expectations.
