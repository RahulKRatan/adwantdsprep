    The problem could also be solved in-place. O(M×N) space complexity could be too expensive when the board is very large. We only have two states live(1) or dead(0) for a cell.
    We can use some dummy cell value to signify previous state of the cell along with the new changed value.

    For e.g. If the value of the cell was 1 originally but it has now become 0 after applying the rule, then we can change the value to -1.
    The negative sign signifies the cell is now dead(0) but the magnitude signifies the cell was a live(1) cell originally.

    Also, if the value of the cell was 0 originally but it has now become 1 after applying the rule, then we can change the value to 2.
    The positive sign signifies the cell is now live(1) but the magnitude of 2 signifies the cell was a dead(0) cell originally.

    the only trick is to denote live --> die as -1 and die --> live as 2
