/**
 * Intuition and Algorithm
 *
 * Count the frequency of each word, then add it to heap that stores the best k candidates.
 * Here, "best" is defined with our custom ordering relation, which puts the worst candidates at the top of the heap.
 * At the end, we pop off the heap up to k times and reverse the result so that the best candidates are first.
 *
 * In Python, we instead use heapq.heapify, which can turn a list into a heap in linear time, simplifying our work.
 *
 *
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(Nlogk), where N is the length of words.
 * We count the frequency of each word in O(N) time,
 * then we add N words to the heap, each in O(logk) time. Finally,
 * we pop from the heap up to kk times. As k \leq Nkâ‰¤N, this is O(Nlogk) in total.
 *
 * In Python, we improve this to O(N + k \log {N})O(N+klogN): our heapq.heapify operation and counting operations are O(N)O(N), and each of kk heapq.heappop operations are O(\log {N})O(logN).
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(N), the space used to store our count.
