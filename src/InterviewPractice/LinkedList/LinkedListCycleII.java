 * We know that Floydâ€™s Cycle detection algorithm terminates when fast and slow pointers meet at a common point.
 * We also know that this common point is one of the loop nodes (2 or 3 or 4 or 5 in the above diagram). We store the address of this common point in a pointer variable say ptr.
 * Then we initialize a counter with 1 and start from the common point and keeps on visiting next node and increasing the counter till we again reach the common point(ptr).
 * At that point, the value of the counter will be equal to the length of the loop.
